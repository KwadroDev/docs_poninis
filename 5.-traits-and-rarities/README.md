# 🐎 Traits & Rarities

They are 100% unique, each of their features is worked separately and joined randomly, so that the collection is more fun and interesting.

****

{% hint style="danger" %}
Traits & Rarity percentages will be updated once the NFT drops and they are on the market to have the most accurate data
{% endhint %}



It should be noted that the Opensea market shows the rarity with a percentage and the lower the number, the rarer it is because fewer such traits exist.
