Interested parties should be aware of the risks of theft and misappropriation of NFT Ponini's by criminals, and Ponini's should not be expected to be fully protected from such crimes. Additionally, technology development is highly unpredictable and could present unknown security risks to NFT Ponini's and/or Ponini's.&#x20;
